(thanks @317slayer and @drunk_cookies!). . 1. halo 2/3 can\\'t pick. 2. rocket league. 3. kingdom hearts 2. 4. super mario bros all stars (this was probably the first game i ever played). . @demintele_sway @discospider93 @void_bwungus @lstesports let’s see em! bl3 using girl on fire for the end credits is why i’m gonna quit borderlands forever yoooooooooo i\\'m actually so hyped for this movie bc all those games are okay this borderlands is the best of its kind modern warfare for $38, borderlands 3 for $20, and more great game deals (ps4, xbox one, switch) unsorted.co/modern-warfare… https://t.co/2n68qojkhu the next one is borderlands: the handsome collection. you\\'re welcome i disagree. psycho krieg and the fantastic fustercluck is a wonderful end to the borderlands 3 dlc line that focuses on a fan favorite character and gives long lasting players closure on some very big questions of krieg’s character and memorable set pieces players interact with. i hate this algorithm this april patch + mini dlc for borderlands 3 is amazing. the events, the new difficulty modifiers, the ramp up in gear stats, all combine to make the game fresh yet again. hey guys! @optus appears to have had an accident just as the stream was getting good! as an apology i\\'ll be back tomorrow for more borderlands! once again, big apologies, no idea what happened! big hearty congratulations to my @playapex @respawn @callofduty @borderlands @destinythegame families on your @baftagames nominations!!!

who else is hyped!? let\\'s hope @treyarch do something to remove the racist and hateful language in black ops cold war since @infinityward don\\'t seem to give a shit screw your dying media company. ronald reagan was one of the best presidents and loved by almost all americans. if you camp in the gulag your a special kinda stupid!!!

ehhh... we\\'ll see. but i\\'ve done all the prep work i can. if it doesn\\'t work, it doesn\\'t work. no biggie. it\\'s just a gpu! nvidia makes such insanely high ends gpus and then we still gotta make games that run on switch at 60fps.. . it\\'s like owning an f1 car but driving through a school zone improving in valorant hehe (p.s sorry for poop quality, nvidia won\\'t clip) pic.twitter.com/oy2smnxfuo holy shit nvidia shield pro is pretty fantastic, not that it shouldn\\'t be given the price of the fricken thing.. . however, twitch streams look amazing and the ai upscaler actually makes them look substantially better when it\\'s running.. . haven\\'t tested the game streaming yet, though. anyone notice the ratio between conferred buy vs reviews of the 3080 and 3090 cards? i am getting about 1 to 5. for every 1 card bought to 5 review that are going live! so sad that more people have prerecorded reviews than people have confirmed orders really glad you are part of the team :) welcome  amd gpu’s suck i cant wait to switch to nvidia this nvidia stream is kinda nuts, can\\'t wait to sell my kidney to buy a card exciting times ahead! nvidia to acquire arm for $40 billion, creating world’s premier computing company for the age of ai. nvda.ws/2rk5rry bit.ly/32ukqyq using this right now on zoom and its insane now nvidia has more time to get the 3000 series out. worth it. finally received and installed the rtx 3080 gaming x trio i reserved in september!!. . she’s. so. beautiful. . . . @nvidia @nvidiagamedev @nvidiageforce @msigaming pic.twitter.com/e6lt9fpma7 fuck microsoft and fuck nvidia i’m losing my mind right now nvidia gpudirect for geforce. that would be nice nvidia shield update - new feature ! this is awesome !! - docsquiffy.com/2020/01/30/nvi… @jojobinxyates this is some really cool stuff. .@nvidia’s incredible @nvidia it’s ridiculous how as soon as i get an alert that a 3080 is in stock the website gives me errors until it switches to out of stock. every single time. love it another success of nvidia. the folding@home distributed computing network has received cuda support. watchbha.xyz/another-succes… this man @spriggsian is a genius artist. . . his tools are all digital. i love how new tech allows new genius to be discovered... wow . amd really got so scared of nvidia’s ampere that they quit making gpus and switched to bikes excited to see the 3080s 699 msrp become 1200 aud cause nvidia and the aussie electronic tax merely for existing here. pic.twitter.com/hfztrcqamo if @nvidia acquires arm, what i want to see is big.little graphics cards where desktop apps are handled by a very low power arm gpu on the same board as the rtx gpu for other programs. this way at idle, the gpu uses very low power and generates virtually no heat with fans off. looks like we\\'re all switching to amd gpu\\'s this fall because nvidia can\\'t produce more than 13 3080\\'s for north america  great news from our elite partner @exxactcorp helping enterprises scale samsung is guilty of copying nvidia these nvidia caucuses fuckin crazy the top 16 companies on this list are the most interesting. they have all gained over 50%, and they tell a common story of \"remote,\" whether for work, entertainment, or retail.. . except perhaps nvidia (+78%), which is hanging out in the middle with machine learning. i\\'ve completely flipped. the more i see about xsx, nvidia, ps5 hardware, and the less games we see running on the consoles, the more sure i am xbox has some tricks up their sleeve. . . i\\'m probably wrong... but... ⏳ amd cannot save pc gaming. no one buys amd cards in the main stream. . . gtx 1050 ti out sold rx 570.. gtx 1060 out sold rx580/480. . gtx 780/780ti out sold r9 290/290x. . gtx 2060/2060s out sold rx 5700/5700xt. . . jensen about fuck your wallet. this is insane! makes me want to upgrade my gpu do i even want to know what windows update installed?

https://t.co/h880tfeldm let’s just say nvidia users can be blessed with this, just as a little hint. 🤫 one hour until gtx 3070 launch, currently refreshing the nvidia shop page over and over amazing work @nvidiaai . . (h/t @pwnallthethings) big shit. rt @nvidiacreators: take it to the max. . this year at working at nvidia should be a nice experience new nvidia reference designs certainly look... interesting... im trying to get nvidia control panel running to try and optimize my game but wtf theyve changed some shit cos now it like the geforce experience????? congrats to the nvidia nemo team for the 1.0.0 release candidate!. really excited to see nemo embracing hydra as the way to take control over the configuration madness that is machine learning! :) this is actually amazing. it\\'s obviously kinda limited by the hardware screen resolution but if you use slightly differently to pc usage, you can optimise your vr resolution for free. can\\'t ask for more than that for free driver updates. everyone: why training style gan is so slow.... *nvidia releases stylegan 3*: you can train it in just a few hours. neat!! it would be nice to play it won’t work i tried reposting it so many times yes they are very sad for you. pic.twitter.com/3uql5ih6cu the nvidia broadcast amp came out right now and suddenly, i find myself practicing... pic.twitter.com/yhpzj8h8wt nvidia unprecedented demand for the rtx 3080 causes their online store to crash . @athanville pic.twitter.com/c3f3lh7pnl \"basically, the quarter reported and the quarter now expected are both terrific, in my opinion.\" stephen guilfoyle talks nvidia\\'s business lines, the numbers, the outlook, the $nvda chart, and trading the name. i\\'m no nvidia fanboy (i hate their drivers, and their business practises over the years have been shady at best) but holy jesus fuck that\\'s a lot of performance!!! pic.twitter.com/fjd7a3asx9  and there it is. wow. we are very excited to have joined nvidia’s inception program. as a leading technology provider, nvidia plays an important role in the data science community. hubs.ly/h0rnlqy0 https://t.co/qcguussp2i been almost 2 weeks like this. no update from either @disneyplus or @nvidiashield @nvidia. can\\'t wait to get the new @roku ultra. pic.twitter.com/zywz2swpxq anything for this beast amazing how much cooler my laptop (mbp 15 2016) is when disconnected from external monitor - integrated intel graphics instead of nvidia dedicated. can someone please tell me what nvmoduletracker is and how to stop it from failing when im downloading a new nvidia driver because whenever i download geforce experiecne alone it fails @nvidia the . . global cues. . -world market sentiment looks weak as us indices closed lower.. . -tech . . - . . @blizzardcseu_en ... can you play wow classic with the @nvidiagfn service? i have sent an email and it hasn\\'t been responded to. nvidia say that wow classic and wow bfa will work with the service but i\\'m hearing about propels accounts being banned. is this still the case? it’s like @nvidia wants us to buy @amdgaming . i wanted to buy the rtx 2080 for months sold out is seconds @nvidiageforce said they would fix this problem. they release the rtx 3090 and it’s sold out before launch... how can you be the biggest gpu supplier and not think of stock? @nvidiageforce @nvidia @nvidiashield i just got a brand new nvidia shield controller/gamepad. the right shoulder buttons do not work. does anyone know whats going on or how to fix this?. thank you so much for any help. these prices are way too low. nvidia optimus laptop - external monitor (wired directly to nvidia gpu) has tearing.. zpr.io/h6uu3 new gpu coming in soon (1660), after that i will be streaming gameplays more on twitch.tv/sinfullykayla and will attempt to learn blender for some 3d lewd works while i am still getting 2d down. (i am professionally trained in 3d modelling and animation) @nvidia holy shit these prices are so much lower than i expected!! 500$ for a 3070 which is faster than a 1200$ 2080ti. probably buying the 3080 though pic.twitter.com/7txmrniolf liked on youtube: how to install nvidia drivers on linux (gentoo) youtube.com/watch?v=dvbepr… if my display only support freesync, am i screwed if i want to get an nvidia gpu? nvidia should cancel any order that is suspected of being a bot. this news about the nvidia 3000 series is ligiet the most excited i’ve been about gaming all year. pic.twitter.com/vql4qfukva @nvidiageforce the hell with you nvidia. you all wanted this launch to happen like it did. triggering people to impulse buy so you brag about record sales in your next quarterly round up. holding back your card so you can save bins for the 3070 to counter amd\\'s offer. assholes. love everything about it . checked for new gpu drivers today, went to the amd driver section, tried to select my card, then paused for around 10 seconds completely confused. i then remembered i switched from amd to nvidia 6 months ago. cheap doesn\\'t mean better btw! . . techsall.com/google-challen…. . nvidia really delayed the 3070 2 weeks . let no elim go unnoticed. . . . nvidia highlights automatically records your best moments in @fortnitegame on gfn!. . share them with just realized the windows partition of my mac is like 6 years behind on nvidia drivers and i have no idea how i didn’t notice '"
